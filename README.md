# Dapbase

**A dead-simple, file-based, folder-visible database for Node.js**

No server. No binaries. No black boxes.  
Your data lives in plain files inside a `Dapbase/` folder you can open, read, backup, or edit by hand if you ever want to.

Perfect for small apps, prototypes, CLI tools, learning, or when you just want full control.

## Features

- Zero dependencies
- 100% transparent — see every table as files
- Multiple databases in one project (just create folders)
- Familiar SQL-like API (coming step by step)
- Works offline, in production, or in the browser (future)
- Created for learning and simplicity

## Installation

```bash
npm install dapbase
